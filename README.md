# FinalProjectPrototype
For this project, I embarked on creating an R Shiny application designed to offer users insights into their local food environment by calculating the ratio of fast food outlets to grocery stores within a specified radius. Additionally, I aimed to enhance the user experience with interactive overlays, such as local population data. This endeavor not only honed my skills in utilizing the Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap data, and the Leaflet package for spatial data visualization but also provided a rich learning experience. Delving into these technologies was both challenging and rewarding, opening up new avenues for applying geospatial analysis in web applications. It was an engaging project that significantly deepened my understanding of mapping APIs and interactive data visualization in R.
Beyond that, it was really fun! Even though it melted over the due date a bit, I really enjoyed the satisfaction of getting to master some new skills.
